This is an assignment project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css) that was made to learn/practice my HTML/CSS skills, as well as my knowledge of how to use the browser developer tools.

The goal of this project is to deconstruct and rebuild the Google results page.

- With HTML and CSS I built the structure and styling of the page, visually making it as close to the Google results page as possible (at the time of working with this project).
- Using the Chrome Dev Tools I was able to replicate most elements' styling, as well as copy the vector icons and reuse them on my page. 
- Lastly, I made the page responsive and added some mobile only elements.
